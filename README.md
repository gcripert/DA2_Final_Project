# DA2_Final_Project

##This is my final project for Code Louisville's Data Analysis track, ending summer 2023. I will be delving into some data sets from a competition hosted by retail fashion brand H&M last year. All relevant data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data. My objective is to examine trends in customer purchasing history to anticipate future behavior.
