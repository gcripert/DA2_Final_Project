# DA2_Final_Project

### Project Overview

This is my final project for Code Louisville's Data Analysis track, ending summer 2023. I will be delving into some data sets from a competition hosted by retail fashion brand H&M last year. All relevant data can be found at a. My objective is to examine trends in customer purchasing history to anticipate future behavior.


### Data Download

Data was downloaded in csv format from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data, then extracted to the 'Data' folder in this repository. In order to access this data, it is necessary to have an active Kaggle account with which you must accept the rules of the competition as set forth by H&M. Note: the competition is no longer active and the rules state that the data is acceptable for use in educational purposes, which is my intent.
