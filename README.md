# Data Analysis 2 Final Project: Customer Trends in Fashion Retail 

### Project Overview

This is my final project for Code Louisville's Data Analysis track, ending summer 2023. I will be delving into some data sets from the clothing retail company H&M. The sets contain two years of data including customer transaction history, customer demographics, and articles purchased. My objective is to clean and combine the data into a more easily readable format, then identify and interpret trends in customer purchases over time. As the second largest international clothing retailer, I am particularly interested in examining how well H&M's target age demographic aligns with actual purchases. Furthermore, I would like to determine the average spending for each given age group.  A visualization of these results can be viewed on my Tableau Pubilc [profile](https://public.tableau.com/views/FashionData/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).


### Data Download

Data was downloaded in csv format from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data, then extracted to the 'Data' folder in this repository. In order to access this data, it is necessary to have an active Kaggle account with which you must accept the rules of the competition as set forth by H&M. Note: the competition is no longer active and the rules state that the data is acceptable for use in educational purposes, which is my intent.
